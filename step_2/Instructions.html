<li>The game I have created is a higher and lower game. When you return to the home page and click play you will see a pair of shoes expensive or inexpensive and it is your job to try to find the price of the shoes. </li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Example</b>
</li>
<a> how much do you think this pair of shoes costs?
  <br>
  <img id = "shoes312" src = "bred312.jpg">
</a>
<br>
<label for="Price">Your Price Guess:</label>
<input type="number" id="Name" name="Name" placeholder="0$">
</ul>
<br>
<a>If your guess is incorrect you will guess again. if your guess is correct you can choose to guess for another pair of shoes.</a>

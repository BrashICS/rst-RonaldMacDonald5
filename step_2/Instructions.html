<li>The game I have created is a higher and lower game. When you return to the home page and click play you will see a pair of shoes expensive or inexpensive and it is your job to try to find the price of the shoes. you have ten guesses to guess the price of the pair of shoes. </li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Example</b>
</li>
<a> how much do you think this pair of shoes costs?
  <br>
  <img id = "shoes312" src = "bred312.jpg">
</a>
<br>
<label for="Price">Your Price Guess:</label>
<input type="number" id="Name" name="Name" placeholder="0$">
</ul>
<br>
<a>If your guess is incorrect you will guess again. if your guess is correct you will receive points and move on to the the next pair of shoes.</a>

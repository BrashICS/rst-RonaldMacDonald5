<li>The game I have created is a higher and lower game. When you return to the home page and click play you will see a pair of shoes and a given supposed price it is your job to try to find the price of the shoes you have ten guesses and each guess will tell you if the actual price is higher or lower then yout guess. </li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Example</b>
</li>
<a> how much do you think this pair of shoes costs?
  <br>
  <img id = "shoes312" src = "bred312.jpg">
</a>
<br>
<label for="Price">Your Price Guess:</label>
<input type="number" id="Name" name="Name" placeholder="0$">
</ul>
<br>
<a>If your guess is incorrect you will guess again. if your guess is correct you will receive points and move on to the the next pair of shoes.</a>
